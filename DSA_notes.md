# DSA Notes
Data Structures are of two types, linear, non-linear. Examples of linear data structures are, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues. Examples of non-linear data structures are graphs, and trees.
Linear data structures are of two types, static and dynamic. Static data structures such as an array have a fixed memory size. Non static data structures are queues, stacks, linked lists whose memory can be updated at runtime. Foe example, new nodes can be added to a linked list.
